Julie Vanopdenbosch a Belgian **webdesigner and front-end developer**. She's been doing all things front-end for over ten years. 
After working for Duval Guillaume and Ogilvy as a designer, she got the opportunity to develop her skills as a front-ender at Statik, with a focus on drupal theming. These experiences made her the front-end all-rounder with a focus on design.  
She now loves working at [2dotstwice](https://www.2dotstwice.be), a small webdevelopment company in Leuven, Belgium.

Julie works with an eye for detail and an urge for perfection. Through a love for **minimalism** and **no-nonsense** design, she aims to deliver **clear, usefull and good looking** results.
