## logo design for veterinary clinic
<p>I was asked to design a new logo for a veterinary clinic. I was inspired by 'cute japanese animal drawings'. I wanted to use the typical elements of a cat and dog, as in the name. But as I remebered the times I was at a veterinary clinic myself, was always as a child. I remebered the place as a scary one that enforced my worrying for the illness of my favorite pet. This led me to try and make the logo 'lightweight' and humorous, hoping to relief anxious visitors in a waiting room.</p>
