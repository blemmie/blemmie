## logo for school for children socio-emotional problems
'De liaan' (the liana) is a new school that focusses on children with socio-emotional problems. Instead of regular tutoring, they provide an adapted teaching method. I was asked to design a new logo for them that translated the idea of movement, joy and learning. As many of these children physically need movement to express themselves, classic education is difficult for them. There, movement is a 'problem'. On the other hand, as De liaan provides adapted teaching methods, this need gets a place and becomes an opporunity to grow and to actually move forward. So 'movement' becomes a tool to learn and joyously jump forward to their future.
