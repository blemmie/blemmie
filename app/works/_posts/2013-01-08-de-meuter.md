## responsive design and wordpress theming
De Meuter is a large Belgian demolishing contractor. They have a clear visibility in every city where they work, due to their bright orange vehicles, cranes, demolishers etc.
I was asked to make a clear, 'flat' design, focussing on this recognisable orange color. Apart from the responsive design, I also did the wordpress theming. Development was done by Spud from Bungalow Bill.
